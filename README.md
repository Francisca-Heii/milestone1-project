##  Milestone Project 1
### Created a Pesrsonal Portifolio Website

[Check out my deployed website](https://francisca-heii.github.io/milestone1-project/)

Hi there!

This project is about building a static front-end Portifolio Website. The goal of the application is to showcase my education, skills, work 
history, to grow my professional network and also serve as my personal brand. Addition to that is to let others reach out if need arise. The key primarily user of the website are recruiters. Although other people 
can visit the site if it catches their interest. The website allows potential recruiters to see my work, what I am capable of, what are my strengths 
and work history. This gives them a better understanding of how I may fit in with their vision or existing company culture.
This website also tries to address the convinience to share my work as more people are added to the interview panel.The website features home, about
me page, portifolio and contact page.

### UX

The key users for the site are recruiters, searching to recruit a suitable developer for the job available. My website make me available, searchable and let's potential recruiters find me the moment they use the a serach engine or scanning through developer's application. Another goal is the ability to
easily add and update new projects when completed,skills and acomplishement to my website to keep it up to date and recruiters can always re-visit the website at a 
later stage to check what new skills, or projects are added to the website since they last visited. 

### Visitors to the website want to achive the following:
* To easily navigate around the developer’s website.
* To find out what skills set the developer has and the projects they have worked on.
* To find out about the developer’s work history.
* To read about the developer's bio.
* To be able to re-visit the website to check if, is there anything new added to the developer’s website. 
* To see if the developer is on any social media platforms where they can connect with them.
* To contact the developer if they need to.

### This project is the best way to help them achieve this things because:

* The website has a clear and simple navigation for the user to find what they are looking for intuitively.
* The website has a fixed navigation bar at the top and the user can easily choose to go to another page regardless of the current page they are on.
* The site itself shows my work and provides a tangiable proof of my skills and abilities, it gives the user confidence and some trust not just telling.
* The content is relevant and on point.
* All the links open in a new tab and the user will not forget about my website. They can easily go back when they close the new tab that is open.

### DESIGN:

 #### Color scheme

- The main colors used: is green rgb(121,152,154) for both the navigation bar and footer background. For the buttons, a dark shade grey rgb(48, 54, 52) is used and a black color on hoover. For the cards a light gray color rgb(211,211,211) is used.
Social links a dark shade grey rgb(48, 54, 52) is used with a orange color when hoovered.

#### Typography
- Two main fonts are used, the first one is the Oswald fonts which is used in all the headings and the navigation bar.The second font is Lato, which is used in the paragraph content along with Sans Serif
as a fall back font, this means for some resons if Lato fails to load the Sans Serif will load up to back the failed font. The same idea
also applies with Oswald where Sans Serif is used as a fall back font.

#### Imagery
- My profile picture.

### Responsiveness of the website:

- Chrome Developer tools and AM I Reponsive was used to test the responsiveness of the webiste on different device screen sizes.

<p align="center"><img width="1080" height="300" src="readme-images/responsive.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><img width="1080" height="300" src="readme-images/url.jpg"></p>

###### NOTE BEFORE: 

- The website is responsive on all devices. Images and links work as expected.


#### Browser Compatability

<p align="center"><img width="900" height="150" src="readme-images/browesercom.jpg"></p>


##### NOTE BEFORE: 

- The website is compatable on most browsers. This was tested on Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Microsoft edge browsers.Although in Opera and Edge the text is 
very difficult to read when the website is viewed on Ipad pro. 


#### Bugs discovered 

When I added the navigation bar the hamburger was not showing on mobile device and I fixed it with reference from stack overflow.

My profile photo was a little bit challenging to have it displaying properly on small devices. This was fixed by adding a class img-responsive to the image tag and the 
removed the width of the image from the stylesheet.

I faced issue with fonts imported in the stylesheet. The first import was the Oswald fonts, then along the line I tried to use Lato for the paragraphs however it didn't seem to work. 
To fix that I imported Lato fonts in the stylesheet and it worked. This means I have imported two fonts styles instead of using one as it was demontsrated in the love running and resume project, however I don't understand why I 
could not work with one font style. 

In the portfolio page I had issues with the "go to app" and "go to github" buttons. They were stacking on top of one another when viewed on mobile deivice.
To fix that I used "&nbsp" and added padding of 30 px at the top.
