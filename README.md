and work history. This gives them a better understanding of how I may fit in with their vision or existing company culture.
This website also tries to address the convinience to share my work as more people are added to the interview panel.The website features about
me page, portifolio and contact page.

easily add and update new projects when completed,skills and acomplishement to keep the site up to date. The recruiter can always re-visit the website at a 
later stage to check what new skills, or projects are added to the website since they last visited.

## DESIGN:

 #### Color scheme

- The main colors used is green rgb(121,152,154) for the navigation bar and footer background. A dark shade grey rgb(48, 54, 52) for the button with a black color when hoover. For the card a light gray color rgb(211,211,211) is used.
Social links a dark shade grey rgb(48, 54, 52) is used with a orange color when hoover. 

### Typography
- Two main fonts are used, the first one is the Oswald fonts which is used in headings and the navigation bar.The second font is Lato, which is used in the paragraph content along with Sans Serif
as a fall back font, this means for some resons if Lato fails to load the Sans Serif will load up to back the failed font. The same idea
also applies with Oswald. Problem which can arise from this it could be that, the fonts is not loaded properly or issues with the time it takes
for the font to load there are actually various factors to this.

#### Imagery
- My profile picture.
