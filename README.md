## Pesrsonal Portifolio Website
Hi there!
 
This project is about building a static front-end Portifolio Website. The goal of the application is to display my education, skills, work 
history, to grow my network and also serve as a personal brand.The key primarily user of the website is the recruiter. Although other people 
can visit the site if catches their interest. The website allows potential recruiters to see my work, what I am capable of, what are my strengths 
and work history. This gives them a better understanding of how I may fit in with their vision or existing company culture.
This website also tries to address the convinience to share my work as more people are added to the interview panel.The website features about
me page, portifolio and contact page.

## UX

The key users for the site is the employer, searching to recruit a suitable candiate for the job available. Another goal is the ability to
easily add and update new projects when completed,skills and acomplishement to keep the site up to date. The recruiter can always re-visit the website at a 
later stage to check what new skills, or projects are added to the website since they last visited. 

### Visitors to the website want to achive the following:
* Search the candinadtes with the right skill set for the job available.
* To short list the relevant candinadtes for an interview.
* To be able to re-visit the website to check what the candinate have been up to.
* How to contact the candiate if they need to.

### This project is the best way to help them achieve this things because:

* The website has a clear and simple navigation for the user to find what they are looking for intuitively.
* The site itself shows my work and provides a tangiable proof of my skills and abilities, not just telling.
* The content is relevant and on point.

## DESIGN:

 #### Color scheme

- The main colors used is green rgb(121,152,154) for the navigation bar and footer background. A dark shade grey rgb(48, 54, 52) for the button with a black color when hoover. For the card a light gray color rgb(211,211,211) is used.
Social links a dark shade grey rgb(48, 54, 52) is used with a orange color when hoover. 

### Typography
- Two main fonts are used, the first one is the Oswald fonts which is used in headings and the navigation bar.The second font is Lato, which is used in the paragraph content along with Sans Serif
as a fall back font, this means for some resons if Lato fails to load the Sans Serif will load up to back the failed font. The same idea
also applies with Oswald. Problem which can arise from this it could be that, the fonts is not loaded properly or issues with the time it takes
for the font to load there are actually various factors to this.

#### Imagery
- My profile picture.
